## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode
Add `?debug=1` to your URL to enable:
- **Console Logging**: Detailed speaker detection and assignment logs
- **Debug Panel**: Shows current speaker state and update intervals in the UI
- **API Inspection**: Direct links to debug endpoints
- **Performance Monitoring**: Update frequency and pause state tracking

### Best Practices for UI Interaction
1. **Before changing speaker assignments**: Click ⏸️ Pause to prevent interruption
2. **Before expanding "Show All" sections**: Pause refresh to avoid state conflicts
3. **During detailed data review**: Use pause to prevent screen updates
4. **After UI interactions**: Resume refresh to continue monitoring

### Common Issues

1. **Speaker Assignment Dropdown Closes Unexpectedly**:
   - **Solution**: Pause refresh before changing speaker roles
   - Check that updates are paused in the status bar

2. **"Show All" Sections Collapse Automatically**:
   - **Solution**: Pause refresh before expanding sections
   - Resume after reviewing expanded content

3. **Update Interval Changes Don't Persist**:
   - Settings are saved to localStorage automatically
   - Check browser console for any storage errors

4. **FAINT Data Gets Cleared**:
   - This should no longer happen with the improved data preservation
   - Check that AI is only updating fields with new information

5. **No Audio/Transcription**:
   - Verify RTMS is properly enabled in Zoom
   - Check AssemblyAI API key in environment
   - Monitor server console for connection errors

6. **AI Analysis Not Working**:
   - Verify Anthropic API key is set
   - Check conversation logs for processing errors
   - Ensure transcript data is being received
